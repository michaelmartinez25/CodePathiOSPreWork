# Prework - *Background Party*

Submitted by: **Michael Martinez**

**Background Party** is an app that allows you to change the background color of the screen with the tap of a button! 

Time spent: **0.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- YouTube
    - Multiple tabs for recommended, shorts, subscriptions
    - Video UI is informative and easy to follow
- Notion Calendar
    - Readability
    - Customizable use of notifications and reminders
- iMessage
    - "Quality of Life" features: swipe to reply, hold to react
    - Use of embedded apps, like GIPHY and GamePigeon

## Notes

I found the UI to be difficult to navigate while building this app. I'll eventually get used to commonly used features over time. 

A future app I want to develop is a learning app for my little sister. She's fallen behind in school work, primarily because of the lack of support during the pandemic. I would want to implement features that make reading and math exciting for her. Some features may include:

- Personalized practice lessons
- Incorporated timers for breaks during lessons
- Colorful and fun UI for children
- Rewards system to incentivize learning
